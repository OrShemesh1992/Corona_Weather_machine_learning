## About the project:


******
This project includes three machine learning algorithms:

* logistic regression
* svm
* pca


The dataset we have chosen to use:

* The number of deaths from all countries on different dates

* The amount of those infected from each country on different dates

* The weather every day for the year 2020 from January to April (most up to date for the project)


After connecting the databases using the longitude and latitude, we used algorithms to investigate 
whether the temperature affects the number of people infected and dead from the corona virus
